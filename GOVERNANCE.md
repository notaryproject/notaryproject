# Governance

## Project Maintainers

[Project maintainers](CODEOWNERS) are responsible for all activities
maintaining and updating the Notary project. Final decisions on the projects
reside with the project maintainers.

Maintainers MUST remain active. To remain active they MUST collaborate on the 
project at least once in a 3 month period. Example collaborations include, attending
the community meeting, creation or commenting on issues/PRs, PR reviews, etc. 
If they are unresponsive for >3 months, they will be automatically moved to emeritus unless a
[super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) of
the other project maintainers agrees to extend the period to be greater than 3
months.

New maintainers can be added to the project by a
[super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote)
vote of the existing maintainers. A potential maintainer may be nominated by an existing maintainer.
Submissions for new maintainers can be made by creating an
[issue](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/issues/new). The current maintainers will be able to cast
a single vote each via a +1 comment on the issue. Once a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote)
has been reached a pull request is made on the repo adding the new
maintainer to the [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) file.

All changes to the main branch require approval by two active maintainers prior to merge.

A maintainer may step down by submitting an
[issue](https://github.com/notaryproject/notaryproject/issues/new) stating their intent and they will be moved to emeritus.

Changes to this governance document require a pull request with approval from a
[super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) of
the current maintainers.
